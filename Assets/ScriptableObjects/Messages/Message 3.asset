  - You thought I was done?
  - Haha nope!
  - As you can see, there are not enough blocks to progress to the next level.
  - But fear not!
  - Press 'Space' to reveal the blocks which are hiding cheekily
  - The blocks are now highlighted meanwhile others are greyed out.
  - You have a <color=red>limited</color> number of tries to reveal positions
  - Try to get all of them with the tries! Good luck!
